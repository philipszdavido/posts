dear. It is not easy ðŸ’š I'm happy for you. â˜º Soon it'll be a frequent thing for you.
I remember what one man did on our Air Peace flight from Lagos to Abuja two years ago.
The guy who sat beside me on this flight was struggling with his seat belt. The centre seat was unoccupied.
I noticed and offered to help him.
"No my boy, not to worry. I got this."
He never did.
After a while, he relaxed and allowed me to help him out.
Then he started talking and made me really wonder why I've never encountered this type of genuine craze all along.
"My boy, I know how to do that belt thing. I fly regularly you know."
I just nodded and remained taciturn.
"So my boy, what's your name?"
"I'm Martin Beck Nworah. And I'd suggest you drop the boy thing Sir, if you don't mind."
"Apologies my boy. Have you been to France before?"
I replied him in the negative.
"Oh sad my boy Beck. Were you in Lagos few days ago when Manana Macaroni, the French President came to Lagos?"
"I was in Lagos. And his name is Emmanuel Macron by the way."
I was starting to feel really uneasy, but I kept my calm. The lady sitting in front noticed the awkward convo and stole a glance at us.
"Have you been to Brazil my boy Beck?"
I gave him a stern look, dropped the book I was reading and faced him.
"Can I ask you something my man?"
"Oh sure. Go on."
"Do you want to know where I have been? Do you really wish to know where Martin Beck Nworah has been?"
"Tell me my boy."
I moved a little close to his face.
"I have been to school my man. I have been to a place called classroom where I was taught to respect strangers and their personal space. And if you don't focus on this 2014 magazine in your right hand, I will school you in manners."
I smiled, tapped his left hand and returned to my book.
As we got close to arrival, he tapped me.
"My guy, abeg no vex. I just wanted to show say I belong to this rich life something. Na my first time flying be this sef. Abeg Beck no vex."
I wasn't really surprised, I know his type when I see one.
"It's okay. Just know when to play this your crazy game of belonging. It could cost you a lot sometimes you know."
He nodded.
"Errm Martin Beck Nworah, can I have your number?"
It was my turn to shine and I used it well.
"I don't use phone. I only use emails."
He was transfixed.
Know where you stand, always keep it in mind and work hard for where you want to be.
Till we get to the Promised Land, I shall be waiting for when you will pass me a glass of water and thank God for the gift of grace for the race.
